Aoife

1. What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
I'm good at designing sprites and a visual feeling for the game and I feel like I have a good understanding of some game design concepts like creating a polished core gameplay loop. I think I'm also good at working with a team and trying to integrate everyone's ideas into one cohesive whole.

I will make most of the sprites and backgrounds for the game (unless anyone else wants to!) and try to work on the core gameplay elements to make sure they work really smoothly.

I want to improve my organization and time management. I'm going to try to play out most or all of my tasks early on in the project to make sure that I can allocate enough time for each of them.
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Each day we'll do a standup and make sure everyone is on the same page with what's been done and what needs to be done, and change our plans as needed if new ideas or problems come up.
